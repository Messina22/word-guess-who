# Sight Word Guess Who - Project Plan

## Overview

A web-based educational game inspired by the classic "Guess Who" board game, but using sight words instead of character faces. Two players compete to guess each other's secret word by asking yes/no questions about letter patterns, sounds, and word characteristics. Players can tap cards to flip them over, eliminating words that don't match the answers—just like the physical Guess Who game.

## Game Concept

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: An instructor creates a game configuration with a word bank (e.g., 24 sight words) and a set of suggested questions
2. **Game Start**: Two players join a game session. Each player sees the same grid of word cards. The game secretly assigns each player a target word from the bank
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns asking yes/no questions about their opponent's word (e.g., "Does your word have the letter 'e' in it?")
4. **Card Flipping**: After hearing the answer, the asking player taps cards on their board to flip over words that are eliminated based on the response
5. **Guessing**: When a player thinks they know the opponent's word, they can make a guess
6. **Winning**: First player to correctly guess the opponent's word wins

### Example Questions

- "Does your word have the letter 'a' in it?"
- "Does your word start with a consonant?"
- "Does your word have more than 4 letters?"
- "Does your word rhyme with 'cat'?"
- "Does your word have a silent letter?"
- "Does your word have a double letter?"

### Game Rules & Behavior

#### Grid Setup
- **Both players see the same words in the same positions** on their game boards
- The instructor selects which words from the word bank (up to 100 words) will appear in each game
- Grid sizes: 12, 16, 20, or 24 cards depending on configuration

#### Card Flipping
- **Manual flipping only (MVP)**: Players tap/click cards to flip and eliminate words based on the answers they receive
- Auto-evaluation (highlighting cards that match/don't match a question) is a **future enhancement**

#### Turn Flow
1. Player A asks a yes/no question about Player B's secret word
2. Player B answers "yes" or "no"
3. Player A manually flips cards to eliminate words
4. Player A can optionally make a guess, or pass
5. Turn switches to Player B

#### Reconnection
- **Players can rejoin** a game in progress if they disconnect
- Game state is preserved and restored upon reconnection
- Players rejoin using the same game code and player name

#### Game Room Lifecycle
All game rooms expire after **5 minutes** in these scenarios:
- Room created but second player never joins
- Game completed (room persists briefly for rematch option)
- Both players disconnect

#### Configuration Visibility
- Game configurations are **public**: all instructors can view configurations created by other instructors
- Instructors **cannot edit** other instructors' configurations
- Instructors can **copy/duplicate** configurations to create their own versions

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Runtime | [Bun](https://bun.sh) |
| Language | JavaScript/TypeScript |
| Frontend Framework | React |
| Backend/API | Bun's built-in HTTP server |
| Real-time Communication | WebSockets (via Bun) |

## Art Style

**Theme**: Playful, kid-friendly with bright colors

- Vibrant, engaging color palette suitable for young learners
- Friendly, approachable visual design
- Clear, readable typography for sight words
- Fun animations for card flips and game events
- Visual feedback that feels rewarding and encouraging

## Deployment

### Hosting Options

| Option | Platform | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **Container** | Fly.io | Easy deploy, global edge, WebSocket support, free tier | Paid for scaling |
| **Container** | Railway | Git-based deploys, simple UI, good free tier | Limited customization |

| **PaaS** | Render | Native Bun support, auto-deploy from Git | Cold starts on free tier |

**Recommended**: **Fly.io** or **Railway** for simplicity with WebSocket support.

### CI/CD Pipeline

We'll use **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment.

### Docker Configuration

##### `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1 AS base
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
FROM base AS deps
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile --production

# Build the application
FROM base AS builder
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN bun run build

# Production image
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3000

# Copy built assets and production dependencies
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/configs ./configs

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["bun", "run", "dist/server/index.js"]
```

##### `fly.toml` (Fly.io configuration)

```toml
app = "word-guess-who"
primary_region = "iad"

[build]

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0

[env]
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[vm]]
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 512
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun --watch src/server/index.ts",
    "build": "bun build src/server/index.ts --outdir dist/server --target bun",
    "start": "bun run dist/server/index.js",
    "test": "bun test",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "format": "prettier --write src/"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3000) | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development/production) | No |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Path to game configs directory | No |
| `DATA_PATH` | Path to runtime data directory | No |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret for session signing | Yes (prod) |

### GitHub Secrets Required

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | Fly.io API token for deployments |
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway token (if using Railway) |

### Branch Protection Rules

Configure on GitHub repository settings:

- **Require PR reviews** before merging to main
- **Require status checks** to pass (CI workflow)
- **Require branches to be up to date** before merging
- **Do not allow bypassing** the above settings

## Resolved Decisions

| Decision | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Frontend Framework | React |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Database | SQLite |
| Card Flipping | Manual (MVP), Auto-evaluation (future) |
| Word Selection | Instructor chooses from word bank |
| Grid Arrangement | Same words, same positions for both players |
| Mobile Support | Future enhancement (not MVP) |
| Reconnection | Players can rejoin with same game code |
| Room Expiration | 5 minutes max in all scenarios |
| Config Visibility | Public (view-only, no cross-editing) |
| Art Style | Playful, kid-friendly with bright colors |
| Player Count | 2 players (MVP), Team mode (future) |
| Solo Practice | Future enhancement (AI opponent) |
| Game Statistics | Future enhancement (post-MVP) |
